<h1> Hi There 👋🏽 </h1>

<p>
  Hi I'm <Strong>Kieran Singh</strong>. I like building things, I started my programming journey last December and I've been enthralled by it since, even with a few(a     lot) of hiccups and challenges along the way. Currently, I'm trying to learn as much as I can about FrontEnd Development and am getting comfortable with React. 
  
  I <strong>love</strong> the challenge programming offers and the drive it provides to constantly improve, learn new things and above all try new things.  
</p>

<h3> How I'm currently going ⏱ </h3>
<p> I'm currently going through the Odin Project's curriculum but enjoy branching out and trying projects on my own or through other sources such as frontend mentor. </p>

<p> Aside from that, I like learning all things related to frontend development and find myself learning new things every day. </p>

<h3> What I'm Looking For 🟠 </h3>

<p> Coming from a design background, I feel a certain affinity for front end development and enjoy both the logical and design challenges that it brings. I'm passionate about the process that goes into building websites and webapps and am looking for a junior developer position to use my skills and learn amongst professionals.
